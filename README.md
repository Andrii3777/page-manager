# Page Manager

## Project Description:

Create a page manager. It will consist of two parts:

- Admin panel. Requirements:
  - Protected by password (any implementation);
  - Located in {site url}/admin
  - List of existing pages with ability to delete page;
  - Create page form:
    - title; - meta description;
    - content (wysiwyg editor);
    - url slug.
- Pages. Requirements:

  - Located in {site url}/{url slug}.

- All fields should be validated before saving to DB;
- Form should remain filled in case of - validation errors;
- Url slug must be unique;
- The app has to run on port from config.

## Development requirements

- Should work on Node v18+ / MySQL or PostgreSQL / HTML5;
- Donâ€™t use backend frameworks (Express.js is allowed);
- You can use 3rd-party mysql libs, validation libs;
- Character encoding is UTF-8 everywhere: SQL, HTML, JS;
- You can use TypeScript;
- Keep your code well structured, see best practices for coding on Node.js
- Create a private repository on bitbucket.org and share it with our account - services@codeit.pro.
- Deploy your project on any free hosting and provide us with a url.

  - Programming language - **Javascript**
  - Framework - **Express.js**
  - Database - **MySQL**
- Frontend:
  - Programming language - **Javascript**
  - Library - **React.js**

- `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL`: The admin email for frontend use. Default is `adminEmail@example.com`.
- `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: The admin password for frontend use. Default is `adminPassword123`.

## Database

Database for **Page Manager** includes next tables:

### 1. admin

The admin table stores information about administrators who manage the system. It includes the following fields:

- `id`: An integer that serves as the primary key. It is auto-incremented and uniquely identifies each admin.
- `email`: A string (maximum length 255) that stores the hashed password of the admin. It cannot be null.
- `password`: A string that stores the admin's password, which is also not null.
- `createdAt`: A timestamp that stores the date and time when the admin record was created. It defaults to the current timestamp.

### 2. refreshToken

The refreshToken table stores refresh tokens associated with admins. It includes the following fields:

- `id`: An integer that serves as the primary key. It is auto-incremented and uniquely identifies each refresh token.
- `token`: A text field that stores the refresh token itself. This field cannot be null.
- `adminId`: An integer that references the id field in the admin table. It establishes a relationship between the refresh token and the corresponding admin. When the admin is deleted, their associated refresh tokens are also deleted (using ON DELETE CASCADE).

### 3. page

The page table stores information about web pages managed in the system. It includes the following fields:

- `id`: An integer that serves as the primary key. It is auto-incremented and uniquely identifies each page.
- `metaDescription`: A string (maximum length 255) that stores the title of the page. This field cannot be null.
- `content`: A text field that stores the main content of the page. This field cannot be null.
- `urlSlug`: A string (maximum length 255) that stores the unique URL-friendly identifier for the page. It must be unique and cannot be null.
- `createdAt`: A timestamp that stores the date and time when the page record was created. It defaults to the current timestamp.
- `updatedAt`: A timestamp that stores the date and time when the page record was last updated. It is automatically updated to the current timestamp whenever the record is modified.

## Initial Database Data

Initial Administrator
Upon the first launch of the system, an initial administrator is created using the credentials defined in the environment variables:

Email: The value from the ADMIN_EMAIL variable.
Password: The value from the ADMIN_PASSWORD variable.
This initial administrator account is used to log in and create additional administrators.

#### The application includes SQL scripts to create and populate the database tables. These scripts are located in the src/sql/scripts directory:

- `src/sql/scripts/createTables.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to create the necessary tables in the database.
- `src/sql/scripts/fillTables.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to populate the created tables with initial data.

## Authentication

The application uses **JSON Web Tokens** (JWT) for authentication. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It allows the application to verify the identity of users and provide secure access to protected resources.

### JWT Tokens

The application uses two types of JWT tokens:

- `Access Token`: This token is used to access protected routes and resources. It has a short expiration time for security purposes.
- `Refresh Token`: This token is used to obtain a new access token when the current access token expires. It has a longer expiration time.

### Storage of Tokens

- `Access Token`: The access token is stored in the client's local storage. It is included in the Authorization header of requests to protected routes.
- `Refresh Token`: The refresh token is stored in an HTTP-only cookie to enhance security. It is also stored in the database in the refreshToken table for verification purposes.

### Token Flow

1. **User Login**: Upon successful login, the server generates an access token and a refresh token. The access token is sent to the client in the response and stored in local storage. The refresh token is sent as an HTTP-only cookie and stored in the refreshToken table in the database.
2. **Accessing Protected Routes**: When the client makes a request to a protected route, it includes the access token in the Authorization header. The server verifies the token using the requireAuth middleware.
3. **Refreshing Tokens**: If the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token by making a request to the refresh endpoint. The server verifies the refresh token stored in the cookie and generates new tokens.

## Middlewares

### Authentication Middleware: `requireAuth`

This middleware ensures that requests to protected routes are authenticated. It checks for the presence and validity of an access token in the `Authorization` header of the request in the following format:`Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.If the access token is missing or invalid, it returns an appropriate error response.

### Usage:

The requireAuth middleware is used to protect the following routes:

- POST `/admin/create`
- POST `/admin/pages`
- PUT `/admin/pages/:id`
- DELETE `/admin/pages/:id`
- GET `/admin/pages `

Error Responses:

- **401 Unauthorized:**

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Unauthorized. No token is found"
  }
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Unauthorized. Token is invalid"
  }
  ```
